Representing a variety of mediums, including performance, installation, photography and video, the works on view illustrate how Experimental artists engaged with pressing issues such as subjectivity in age of rapid modernization and globalization, and individual will at the fringes of an increasingly authoritarian state.

Bach, the second son of J.S. Bach, occupies a stylistic realm that defies easy classification, with a creative voice that is uniquely his own. Recognized as a vital bridge between two musical eras, he played a pivotal role in shaping the evolution from the ornate and structured Baroque period to the clarity and balance of the emerging Classical era. His keyboard compositions bear witness to his innovative spirit, marked by inventive ornamentation, phrasing, and dynamic nuances that empower performers with interpretative latitude. This artistry is brilliantly harnessed by Bezuidenhout, particularly evident in his rendition of the Piano Concerto in D minor.\\\\n\\\\nConcluding the program is Mozart, in many respects a spiritual heir to the Bach lineage.

Trained at the New England Conservatory in Boston before moving to the midwest, she found success during the Chicago Black Renaissance, writing music that blended spirituals and folk tunes with classical forms. Though her work faded into relative obscurity after her death in 1953, the discovery of a significant cache of her compositions in 2009 brought about a revival of her work.

While continuing her studies at The Juilliard School, Bonds\\u2019s encounter with Langston Hughes sparked a creative friendship that resulted in her setting many of his poems to music. As a staunch advocate for fellow Black composers, she founded The Margaret Bonds Chamber Music Society in Harlem to establish a canon of music by Black creators.

The women\\u2014mothers, grandmothers, sisters, wives, daughters, aunties\\u2014were in the background, weaving the threads of their own family history in the spirit of resilience and female solidarity.\\\\n\\\\nUnearthing their memories and, thus, remembering their lives as women and makers of home and family, Matrilineal is conceived as a tribute to his loved ones by way of chronicling history\\u2019s minor narrative within Thai patriarchal society. To do so, Siributr presents an entirely new body of works based on his family heirlooms, ceramics, and tapestries. From large textile installations, embroidered intimate portraits, to reinvented vintage garments through beading and stitching, these works feature his mother and her sisters, and his grandmother in retrospection, reflecting on their personal journeys and legacies. Archival objects and paintings of the artist\\u2019s family are featured with the new embroideries, culminating in the presentation of specifically designed floral arrangements to underline notions of ephemerality and longing, sentiments that connect us as human beings in the circle of life.\\\\n\\\\nThis exhibition will be on view at the Foundation from November 30, 2023, to May 26, 2024. During this six-month exhibition period, the Foundation will offer a variety of monthly public programs. These programs include Memento Mori, an embroidery workshop conducted by Jakkai Siributr; an Ikebana Workshop led by the invited floral artist, Mattana Snidvongse, to encourage reflection on the ephemeral and transitory nature of life \\u2013 sentiments that form the framework of the exhibition; a Kintsugi workshop conducted by Sumanatsya Voharn, providing a meaningful experience to engage with the philosophy of Kintsugi while remembering and beholding the past; and a conversation with Professor John Clark and Jakkai Siributr, moderated by Loredana Pazzini-Paracciani. Finally, the launch of the 'Jakkai Siributr: Matrilineal' catalog, which encapsulates the essence of the show and situates Siributr\\u2019s practice within its social, historical, and artistic context.\", \"category\": \"Visual Arts\", \"discipline\": \"\", \"style\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"\"]}",

Through her art, we are drawn into the sphere of violence, prompted to contemplate alongside her, to share in her indignation, and to endure as she has endured.

In the graceful contours of their wing pairs, scenes of terror unfold, saturated with aggression and raw brutality: bound, subjugated, executed. Each butterfly is endowed with its own name, retrospectively embodying a historically significant event in contemporary Iranian history.\\\\n\\\\nAmong them is Flight PS 725, a poignant reference to the Teheran to Kyiv flight. On January 8, 2020, this flight witnessed the tragic downing of a fully occupied civilian aircraft of Ukraine Airlines shortly after takeoff, struck by two surface-to-air missiles of the Islamic Republic. In Nayzar, a tribute is paid to the residents of the small town of Mahshar in southern Iran, who, faced with soaring prices, could no longer sustain their livelihoods. In November 2019, in protest, they blocked access roads to the oil refineries and were met with the full force of the state apparatus, seeking refuge in the nearby bamboo fields. Under the relentless onslaught of rocket fire, the swamp was stained crimson with their blood.\\\\n\\\\nThe wings in Stained are a poignant homage to the victims of repeated acid attacks. In Zankoshi, a grim allusion is made to the official honor killings of women, a testament to the deeply misogynistic stance of the regime. The butterfly Dokhtar e Abi serves as a living memory to a devoted fan of the Esteghlal football club, who, despite the ban on women entering the stadium, defiantly donned the club\\u2019s blue colors and simply yearned to attend one game. In an act of protest against an impending prison sentence, the girl ultimately set herself ablaze, becoming an icon of the protest movement. In Haft Tappe, the butterfly evokes the uprising of workers at a sugarcane factory in southwestern Iran. Following peaceful protests due to withheld wages in 2018, several representatives of the syndicate were arrested, laying the groundwork for a burgeoning labor movement in Iran.\\\\n\\\\nThese butterflies, extolled in Persian mystical poetry for their devotion and willingness to sacrifice, are transformed through intricate ornamentation into astonishingly aesthetically pleasing artifacts. Embodied by these butterflies are the ancient culture of Persia, its lofty poetry, and the cherished memories of home, security, and maternal love. Notably, the butterfly \\u2013 known as \\u201cParwaneh\\u201d in Persian \\u2013 bears the same name as the artist\\u2019s mother. However, in contrast to these positively charged associations, upon close examination of Forouhar\\u2019s creations, it becomes evident that they are distinguished by nothing but a tragic beauty.\", \"category\": \"Visual Arts\", \"discipline\": \"\", \"style\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"\"]}",

A celebration of art that pushes the boundaries of traditional mediums, Quiet Luxury invites art enthusiasts, collectors, and the public to experience these exceptional artworks that embody the spirit of quiet, yet profound, luxury. Don't miss this opportunity to immerse yourself in a world where figurative surrealism and sculpture collide to create a truly unique artistic experience.\\\\n\\\\nEddy Lee\\u2019s figurative surrealist portrait paintings on exposed wood depict emotive sirens who evoke a sense of mystery and seductiveness. The artist\\u2019s work is inspired by the works of Audrey Kawasaki, lifestyle illustrators of the 60s such as Robert McGinnis and Bob Peak, and anime. Lee\\u2019s colorful, intriguing women are painted with acrylic and gouache on hand-built cradled wood panels.\\\\n\\\\nOriginally from Seattle, Washington, Eddy Lee relocated to Los Angeles in late 2012 to pursue a full-time career as a fine artist. He started his career on the Venice Beach Boardwalk and quickly gained a large following across the United States with exhibitions in San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles.\\\\n\\\\nNando Kallweit is a renowned German sculptor who specializes in creating unique sculptures using bronze and oak. His passion for sculpting began at a young age when he was inspired by a bust of Nefertiti that he saw in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, Kallweit was able to travel to Egypt and see his inspiration in person, which fueled his passion for sculpting even more.\\\\n\\\\nKallweit works with bronze and oak using the \\u201clost wax process,\\u201d allowing the artist to create intricate and finely detailed sculptures. The strength of ancient Egyptian sculptures, the dynamic forms of the modern Cubist movement, and an observation of contemporary life are all inspirations for aspects of his aquiline figures. Combined with a considerate approach, Kallweit renders archaic materials, such as blackened oak and bronze, with a palpable sensitivity. Kallweit\\u2019s work has been exhibited and collected across Europe and the United States.\\\\n\\\\nMark Acetelli traces his interest in creative practice to his mother\\u2019s passion for painting and has explored many forms of creative expression including music, painting, photography, and poetry. The artist\\u2019s work is inspired by the intensely personal, introspective journey of life, and he seeks to evoke a feeling rather than a defined image. He describes the context of his work as \\u201csimple expressions of complex thoughts, created by capturing the physical mixed with the spiritual.\\u201d Acetelli additionally refers to his work as \\\"Absence and Presence\\\" believing that something or someone can be gone, while a presence remains.\\\\n\\\\nReminiscent of Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti's figures, Acetelli's figures take on a translucent architecture within the minimal dimensionality of the surface of the canvas allowing the viewer to imagine each subject\\u2019s movement, motion, and intention. As such, this renders the artist\\u2019s works distinctly perfect embodiments of the principles of Existentialism and its lived encounters \\u2014 encompassing our existential angst, anxiety, and all things absurd.\\\\n\\\\nSince the opening of Artplex Gallery in 2018, the gallery continues to be one of the world's leading art galleries specializing in high-quality, original contemporary art representing a broad spectrum of major international artists.

The exhibition is set to open its doors on November 11, 2023, at 4:00 PM and will be a must-see event for anyone seeking a fresh perspective on the intersection of street culture and contemporary art.\\\\n\\\\nNelson De La Nuez is one of the most sought-after contemporary Pop artists practicing today. His striking, vivid mixed media artwork borrows motifs and messages from the language of wealth, power, fame, excess, taste, and access to cast a narrative about modern society. Known to many as The King of Pop Art, De La Nuez is an innate iconoclast, elevating themes from commerce, pop culture, advertising, and branding to provide commentary on our culture\\u2014showing us that the entire world is for sale\\u2014in a manner that is both ironic and aspirational.\\\\n\\\\nIncluded in the \\u201cWho\\u2019s Who List of the Most Collected Artists of Our Time,\\u201d De La Nuez was born in Cuba and moved as a child to California, where he was initially introduced to many of the iconic images that he uses in his art to this day. De La Nuez currently resides in Los Angeles. His ability to experience these important cultural touchpoints at such a young age with a purely fresh perspective allows him a distinctive point of view\\u2014one that is both critical and embracing, sardonic and sentimental\\u2014that lends his work an air of accessibility and curiosity, and has led to his significant popularity.\\\\n\\\\nSean Keith was born in 1982 and was raised in Las Vegas and Los Angeles.  His passion for art has always been a living, breathing aspect of his life and he uses his signature cartoonish style to comment on real-world obsessions with money, fame, and capitalism. Keith solidified his artistic energies while living and working in Switzerland. Heavily influenced by UK street artist Banksy, his artwork is characterized by a cheeky brand of appropriation using images from popular culture. He subtly alters the picture and its context, shifting the tone to give new meaning to the beloved characters.  A common theme throughout his work is money and the insatiable desire to possess it.\\\\n\\\\nBefore painting his figures, Keith covers the entire canvas with vintage newspaper or other printed materials. The printed text and images on the page serve as a contrast to the artist\\u2019s lushly hand-painted figures, implying the difference between reality and fantasy. A layer of glossy resin is added to cover each artwork, creating a smooth, polished finish to the layered artwork underneath.\\\\n\\\\nGerman artist Thitz puts a new spin on the tradition of the artist on the Grand Tour: he paints city scenes upon paper bags scavenged in the places he visits. The bags are opened out flat for maximum coverage, and the paintings are executed with acrylics in energetic delineations of bird's-eye views of individual landmarks.\\\\n\\\\nThitz takes Pop Art to the next level:  He intensifies it and integrates it with everyday reality, art, life, and their sensorial experience.  His subjects and motifs are born of wide travels.  The cities and places depicted can be immediately recognized, but they do not merely portray views.  They are transformations into the colorful, lineal weave of Thitz\\u2019s art. The rich, infinitely detailed circumstances are translated into a vivid and diverse narrative tissue of line-like events.\\\\n\\\\nSince the opening of Artplex Gallery in 2018, the gallery continues to be one of the world's leading art galleries specializing in high-quality, original contemporary art representing a broad spectrum of major international artists.

The gallery invites patrons to immerse themselves in an exploration of diverse mediums, from Bathily's mastery of rigid and flexible materials to Bellamy's kinetic steel pipe sculptures and Burmood's harmonious abstractions inspired by the natural world. Industrial Rhythm serves as a testament to Artplex Gallery's commitment to fostering dialogue and pushing the boundaries of contemporary art beyond the ordinary, creating a space that welcomes both seasoned art enthusiasts and curious newcomers alike.\\\\n\\\\nAmadou Opa Bathily, born in Bamako in 1987, is a distinguished artist with a rich educational background, having graduated from the National Institute of Arts (INA) and the Balla Fass\\u00e9k\\u00e9 Kouyat\\u00e9 Multimedia Arts and Crafts Conservatory (CAMM-BFK) in Bamako. His artistic journey commenced at a young age in an art recycling workshop, Atelier Miria, where he experimented with various materials, notably metal (can lids).\\\\n\\\\nThrough his diverse experiences in different art schools, Bathily developed a unique perspective on hard materials such as metal, fabric, and leather. His art is marked by the fusion of energy in creation and extraordinary mastery of both rigid and flexible materials, emphasizing the harmony between the artist and the material. Bathily's participation in group exhibitions in Mali and Tunisia, including the \\\"Art de la lumi\\u00e8re\\\" exhibition, reflects his prominence in the art world. He is an integral part of the K\\u00f4r\\u00e8-qualit\\u00e9 II art development program and a laureate of the National City Talent Competition in 2017, showcasing his commitment to artistic excellence across various mediums, including painting, sculpture, installation, and more.\\\\n\\\\nWith a remarkable career spanning two decades and the creation of over 250 large sculpture pieces, D\\u2019Arcy Bellamy stands as a seasoned metal sculptor renowned for his human-scale, abstract, minimalist, and often kinetic sculptures crafted exclusively from steel pipe. Characterized by flowing lines, strong negative space, originality, movement, and shadows, Bellamy's work exudes a rough, unrefined, spontaneous, and playful nature that elicits smiles from viewers.\\\\n\\\\nA self-taught artist, Bellamy embarked on his artistic journey in 2002 at The Creative Arts Center in Dallas, discovering his medium in steel pipe. Despite earning an MBA and enjoying a successful career in sales and design, Bellamy's passion for sculpture has endured, leading to exhibitions in galleries across Boise, Dallas, and Artplex Gallery Los Angeles. His unique process of subtractive fabrication sets him apart, as he carves space and line from each length of pipe, releasing the stored energy within. Bellamy's original sculptures, exhibited nationally, showcase his evolving refinement and consistency in delivering engaging and varied creations.\\\\n\\\\nJacob Burmood, a sculptor with a BFA from Missouri State University and an MFA from the University of Kansas, has been professionally shaping his artistic vision since 1999. Rooted in Springfield, Missouri, Burmood draws inspiration from the natural world, especially his childhood experiences along a creek. His works, created for exhibitions, commissions, and public art competitions, reflect an abstraction of the fluid nature of the universe. The underlying order in his sculptures converges elements into a unified whole, mirroring the harmony found in natural complexities.\\\\n\\\\nBurmood, currently residing and working in Kansas City, Kansas, continues his artistic endeavors in ceramics and sculpture while contributing to the Sculpture and Metals program at Johnson County Community College. His deep connection to the interwoven complexities of the universe shines through in each work, capturing the essence of simplicity and harmony.\\\\n\\\\nSince the opening of Artplex Gallery in 2018, the gallery continues to be one of the world's leading art galleries specializing in high-quality, original contemporary art representing a broad spectrum of major international artists.
